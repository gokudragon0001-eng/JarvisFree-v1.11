# J.A.R.V.I.S — Android voice assistant (source project v1.2)

This is a native Java Android Studio project intended for Android 11 (including OPPO A16). It is a **source project, not a prebuilt or device-tested APK**. It requires Android Studio, JDK 17 and Android SDK Platform 35 to build.

## Included in this version

- Dark JARVIS-style screen with microphone button and text chat.
- Android SpeechRecognizer input and Android TextToSpeech replies. Speech language support depends on the speech service installed on the phone.
- Gemini Developer API chat using the stable model ID `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`. Google lists this model in its current Gemini API model catalogue.
- In-app API-key setup shortcut and local private-preferences storage.
- Local voice commands to open WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Chrome, Maps, Gmail, Spotify, Telegram, Snapchat, TikTok, Camera, Settings, Contacts and Phone/Dialer (only if installed), plus best-match launch by installed app label.
- Google search, YouTube search, website opening, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth settings screens, and media volume up/down. Android opens protected settings pages; it does not silently toggle protected system controls.
- Optional foreground wake-phrase listener. User must start it from the app and can stop it from its persistent notification. Say `Hey JARVIS, open WhatsApp`. This uses Android's speech recognition service (often network-based), consumes battery, and is not a low-power offline hotword engine. Background reliability varies by phone vendor; OPPO battery management may stop it.
- Optional Accessibility Service. User must explicitly enable **JARVIS Phone Control** in Android Accessibility settings. It only enters dictated text into the currently focused editable field; it does not press Send, click arbitrary buttons, or send messages.
- WhatsApp share intent can pass text into WhatsApp; user must choose a recipient and press Send. Contact-name resolution is supported for the explicit format “WhatsApp message to NAME: MESSAGE” when the contact is saved and Contacts permission is granted. The app opens a prefilled WhatsApp chat; the user must review and press Send. Automated sending is intentionally not implemented.

## Setup the free AI

1. Open https://aistudio.google.com/apikey and create a Gemini API key in a project eligible for the Gemini Developer API free tier.
2. Install the app, tap **SET UP FREE AI KEY**, paste the key and save.
3. Internet is required for Gemini chat. Google's free tier has model-specific quotas and eligibility; it can change. Google says free-tier content may be used to improve its products, so do not send passwords, private messages, financial details or other sensitive information. See the official [Gemini API pricing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing), [model list](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) and [billing tiers](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/billing).
4. The key is stored in this app's private SharedPreferences. That is acceptable for a personal test installation, but **not secure for public distribution**: a determined user can extract a key from an APK/device. A production app should call a backend that protects the key and applies per-user quotas. Never publish an APK containing your personal API key.

## Build a debug APK

1. Install Android Studio (current stable), JDK 17 and Android SDK Platform 35 / Build Tools from SDK Manager.
2. Open the `JarvisFree` folder in Android Studio as an existing Gradle project. If Android Studio asks to create/sync Gradle wrapper files, accept its compatible Gradle 8.9+ wrapper setup (Android Gradle Plugin 8.7.3).
3. Wait for Gradle sync, then choose **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**.
4. Android Studio normally writes the debug APK to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
5. Copy the APK to the OPPO A16, allow installation from that source if Android asks, and install.

## OPPO A16 first-run setup

- Grant Microphone permission when prompted.
- For AI chat, add your own Gemini API key.
- For voice typing inside another app, open JARVIS > **ENABLE OPTIONAL PHONE CONTROL** and enable **JARVIS Phone Control**. This is a powerful Android permission; enable it only because you trust this app.
- For wake phrase, tap **START HEY JARVIS LISTENING**. Keep its ongoing notification visible. To stop it, tap **Stop** in the notification. If OPPO battery management stops the service, allow background activity / disable battery optimization for JARVIS if you choose.

## Important limitations

- No Android SDK, Gradle executable or physical OPPO A16 was available in the build environment used to prepare this source. Therefore the project has **not been compiled, installed or tested on a phone here**. Do not treat it as a verified APK.
- Wake phrase recognition is an experimental foreground speech-recognition loop, not a dedicated always-on offline wake-word engine. It needs microphone permission, internet/service support in many configurations, a persistent notification and battery.
- Gemini AI answers questions; it does not itself get unrestricted phone-control permissions. Device actions are a limited local command set.
- WhatsApp contact lookup, Instagram DM automation, silent sending, arbitrary app control, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi silent toggles, and protected system actions are not included. Android intentionally restricts many of these.
- Free Gemini API quotas and model access can vary by account, region and time.


## Hello wake word update
- On first launch, grant microphone permission. JARVIS starts its foreground wake listener and shows an ongoing notification.
- Say **Hello** (or **Hello JARVIS**) to wake it, then speak a command when it replies.
- Tap Stop in the notification to stop listening. Wake detection uses Android speech recognition and may require internet depending on the phone's speech provider.
- Android can restrict microphone access while an app is backgrounded; keep the foreground-service notification visible. This is not a guaranteed always-on hotword service.


## v1.3 source updates
- Added saved-contact lookup for the command format `WhatsApp message to NAME: MESSAGE`. The app requests Contacts permission only when this command is used, then opens a WhatsApp prefilled chat. The user must inspect the recipient and text and tap Send.
- Improved installed-app matching using launcher labels (exact and partial matches).
- Added YouTube search and direct website-opening commands.
- This remains a source update and has not been built or tested on the OPPO A16 in this environment. Wake-word listening uses Android SpeechRecognizer, not an offline low-power hotword engine; the user-visible foreground notification is required and the phone may stop it due to battery management.


## Opening a WhatsApp chat by contact name
Say commands such as `Irfan kholo`, `Irfan ko kholo`, `Open chat with Irfan`, or `WhatsApp par Irfan kholo`.
On first use, grant Contacts permission. JARVIS looks up the saved phone number and opens its WhatsApp chat.
No message is sent automatically. For a pre-filled message, say `WhatsApp message to Irfan: Hello Irfan` and press Send yourself after reviewing it.


## v1.6 — Speak message after opening a WhatsApp contact
After a saved contact's WhatsApp chat opens, JARVIS arms a one-message compose mode. Say `Hello` followed by the message; JARVIS returns to WhatsApp and inserts the text into the focused message field using the optional Accessibility service. It never presses Send. The user must review and send manually. Enable **JARVIS Phone Control** in Android Accessibility settings. If the WhatsApp composer is not focused, tap it and retry. Say `Cancel` or `Radd karo` to cancel compose mode.

## v1.8 — Remote access status panel
- Added an in-app Remote Access status panel that clearly explains what is and is not implemented.
- Added GitHub Actions workflow to build and upload a debug APK on pushes to `main` or manual dispatch.
- Live remote screen viewing/touch control is **not implemented yet**: it requires a deployed authenticated signaling service, encrypted WebRTC transport and owner-approved Android MediaProjection capture. See `REMOTE_ACCESS_STATUS.md`.
- Version updated to 1.8. This source has not been compiled or tested on a physical OPPO A16 in this environment.

## v1.9 voice wake and screen lock
Say `Hello` while the visible foreground listening notification is active. Then say `screen lock` (or `Hello screen lock`). The first lock request opens Android's Device Admin consent screen; the owner must approve it. After approval, JARVIS uses Android's `lockNow()` policy to lock the screen. The user can revoke Device Admin in Android Settings.

**Important:** Android's standard SpeechRecognizer detects the phrase, not the speaker's identity. This version does not authenticate the owner's voice and cannot guarantee that another person saying `Hello` will be ignored. Owner-only wake requires a separately implemented and tested speaker-verification model. Keep the phone secure and stop the listening service when not needed.
